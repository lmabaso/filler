#Filler

Filler is a game where two bots are made to compete for space on a map. The bot that places the most tokens wins. 

The filler game is run with the filler_vm and maps that are given to us with the project resources. 
Below is an example of how the vm gives us the map and token. So the bot must read the map and piece from standard input and print out the only the coordinates of where the
x0 -y0 point will be on the map.

For the assessment our bot is put up against the given bots and must win out of 5 rounds on the 3 different size maps.
Below are some examples of how thw filler game will look in action. This is the visualiser that I wrote as a bonus using write
with colour codes. It is very basic but does help us to see the separate players.
